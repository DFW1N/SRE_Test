This folder is responsible for hosting any files related to pipeline tasks.

> NOTE: I have made the decision here to seperate pipelines into seperate directories due to the nature of adding future DevOps platform pipeline solutions to the same modules so they can be utilized this ensures future scalability to the repository.

Example future usage may look like the following:

```bash
azure_devops/
jenkins/
gitlab/
github/
```
